A simple script to login into twitter using Selenium in python.

I was looking for a way to login into twitter using Selenium in python. 
Since 2021, Twitter changed their login screen, so all the previous scripts became useless, so I decided to make my own.
It's a very basic script, but it does the trick.
In the wait to improve it, use it wisely.
